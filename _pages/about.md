I am currently a M.Eng. student at the [School of Integrated Circuits](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) (SEU), starting in Fall 2025. I am advised by [Prof. Yarui Peng](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/pyr/main.htm).

My research interests include **Architecture-Package Co-design** and **Digital Integrated Circuit Design**.

I received my B.Eng. degree in **Electronic Science and Technology** from Southeast University. My undergraduate thesis, *"Research on Semantic Segmentation Algorithms for UAV Perspectives"*, was supervised by Prof. Meng Zhang.
