Research experience
======
* Research on Semantic Segmentation Algorithms for UAV Perspectives
  * Undergraduate Thesis Project, Dec. 2024 - Jun. 2025
  * Model Optimization: Applied transfer learning to optimize a semantic segmentation model based on UAV imagery for natural disaster damage recognition.
  * Scenario Adaptation: Specifically optimized the model for the top-down perspective of UAVs and resource-constrained (low-computing-power) scenarios.
  * Architecture Adjustment: Modified the convolutional layer architecture to significantly reduce computational overhead.
  * Structure Refactoring: Refactored the computation structure of deconvolutional and normalization layers, further reducing computational load while enhancing recognition accuracy.
  * Performance Improvement: Implemented a bounding box approach to improve the overall recognition rate of the model.
  * Advisor: Prof. Meng Zhang

* Project: Design and Development of a Miniature Raman Spectrometer
